# WebLogic server-start Changes
Need to automate the process to update the server-start arguments of hundreds of WebLogic Managed Servers? This is a great place to start.
I wrote this to specifically add in the -javaagent argument with the path to the correct NewRelic agent jar file for each unique Managed 
Server in an environment of 250 Managed Servers.
